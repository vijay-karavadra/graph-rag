    <h1>Ada Lovelace</h1>
    <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on
        Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to
        recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm
        intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer
        programmer.</p>
    <p>Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine include what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be
        processed by a machine. Her contributions to the field of computing were not fully recognized until the 20th
        century.</p>
    <p>Ada Lovelace was born on 10 December 1815 in London, England. She died on 27 November 1852 in Marylebone, London,
        England.</p>
