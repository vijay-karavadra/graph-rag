    <h1>Alan Turing</h1>
    <p>Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and
        theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science,
        providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be
        considered a model of a general-purpose computer.</p>
    <p>Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. During
        World War II, Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to
        defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements.</p>
    <p>Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912 in Maida Vale, London, England. He died on 7 June 1954 in Wilmslow,
        Cheshire, England.</p>
