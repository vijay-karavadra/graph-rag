    <h1>Michelangelo</h1>
    <p>Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni, commonly known as Michelangelo, was an Italian sculptor, painter,
        architect, and poet of the High Renaissance. He is widely considered one of the greatest artists of all time and
        is known for his works such as the statue of David, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, and The Last Judgment.</p>
    <p>Michelangelo's influence on the development of Western art is unparalleled. His work demonstrated a blend of
        psychological insight, physical realism, and intensity never before seen. His contributions to the fields of
        sculpture, painting, and architecture have left a lasting legacy.</p>
    <p>Michelangelo was born on 6 March 1475 in Caprese, Republic of Florence (present-day Italy). He died on 18
        February 1564 in Rome, Papal States (present-day Italy).</p>
