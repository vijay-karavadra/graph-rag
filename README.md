# Graph RAG

Retrievers providing both **unstructured** (similarity-search on vectors) and
**structured** (traversal of metadata properties).

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Graph RAG provides retrievers combining vector-search (for unstructured similarity) and traversal (for structured relationships in metadata).
These retrievers are implemented using the metadata search functionality of existing vector stores, **allowing you to traverse your existing vector store**!

The core library (`graph-retriever`) supports can be used in generic Python applications, while `langchain-graph-retriever` provides [langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/)-specific functionality.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started with LangChain

1. Install `langchain-graph-retriever` (or add to your Python dependencies).

    ```sh
    pip install langchain-graph-retriever
    ```

1. Wrap your existing vector store to enable graph retrieval:

    ```python
    from langchain_graph_retriever import GraphRetriever

    retriever = GraphRetriever(
        # Adapt AstraDBVectorStore for use with Graph Retrievers.
        # Exposes functionality of the underlying store that is otherwise not available.
        store = store,
        # Define the relationships to navigate:
        #   1. From nodes with a list of `mentions` to the nodes with the corresponding `ids`.
        #   2. From nodes with a list of related `entities` to other nodes with the same entities.
        edges = [("mentions", "id"), "entities"],
    )

    retriever.invoke("where is Santa Clara?")
    ```

## Roadmap

Graph RAG is under active development.
This is an overview of our current roadmap - please 👍 issues that are important to you.
Don't see a feature that would be helpful for your application - [create a feature request](https://github.com/datastax/graph-rag/issues)!

* Support more vector stores
* Support [Lazy Graph RAG](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/lazygraphrag-setting-a-new-standard-for-quality-and-cost/) on the retrieved
  documents.
