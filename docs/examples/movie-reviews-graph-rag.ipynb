    "# Graph RAG on Movie Reviews from Rotten Tomatoes\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a basic case study for using graph RAG techniques to\n",
    "combine the power of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with knowledge graphs\n",
    "based on datasets that are linked to one another in a natural way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we use the `GraphRetriever` implementation in LangChain. For more\n",
    "information, see the open-source [Graph RAG project on\n",
    "GitHub](https://datastax.github.io/graph-rag)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The website Rotten Tomatoes has published a [large dataset of movie\n",
    "reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrezaza/clapper-massive-rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-reviews).\n",
    "The dataset includes two CSV files containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the movie reviews, and\n",
    "2. information about the movies referenced in those reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, the challenge is to build a system that allows users to\n",
    "search movie review content using arbitrary prompts, and then return the top\n",
    "reviews together with the full information about the reviewed movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we build a standard RAG system for querying the movie reviews, which are\n",
    "embedded and stored in a vector database. It is important to note that in this\n",
    "step, **we store the embedded reviews together with metadata that is necessary\n",
    "for traversing the knowledge graph and linking reviews with the movie data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we use a `GraphRetriever` that is configured specifically to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. retrieve relevant movie reviews via standard RAG,\n",
    "2. traverse the knowledge graph edges to the relevant movies, and\n",
    "3. return the full movie data together with each movie review.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, the metadata is the basis for the knowledge graph, and\n",
    "the mechanics of graph traversal is specified as part of the `GraphRetriever`.\n",
    "In this way, a change in the configuration of the `GraphRetriever` changes the\n",
    "way that graph edges are defined and how the implied knowledge graph is\n",
    "traversed. There is no need to modify the data set or re-build the knoweledge\n",
    "graph beyond specifying a new `GraphRetriever` configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "See below for how to build this graph RAG system."
