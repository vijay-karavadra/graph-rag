    <h1>Alfred Russel Wallace</h1>
    <p>Alfred Russel Wallace was a British naturalist, explorer, geographer, anthropologist, and biologist. He is best
        known for independently conceiving the theory of evolution through natural selection. His paper on the subject
        was jointly published with some of Charles Darwin's writings in 1858, which prompted Darwin to publish his own
        theory.</p>
    <p>Wallace was a prolific writer and a social activist. He was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the 19th
        century and made significant contributions to the field of biogeography. He is sometimes called the "father of
        biogeography".</p>
    <p>Alfred Russel Wallace was born on 8 January 1823 in Llanbadoc, Monmouthshire, Wales. He died on 7 November 1913
        in Broadstone, Dorset, England.</p>
