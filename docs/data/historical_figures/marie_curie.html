    <h1>Marie Curie</h1>
    <p>Marie Skłodowska Curie was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering
        research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win
        the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields.</p>
    <p>Her achievements included the development of the theory of radioactivity (a term that she coined), techniques for
        isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium. Under her direction, the
        world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms (cancers) using radioactive isotopes.</p>
    <p>Curie was born on 7 November 1867 in Warsaw, Poland. She died on 4 July 1934 in Passy, Haute-Savoie, France.</p>
