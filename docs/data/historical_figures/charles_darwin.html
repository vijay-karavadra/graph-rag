    <h1>Charles Darwin</h1>
    <p>Charles Robert Darwin was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, best known for his contributions to
        the science of evolution. His proposition that all species of life have descended from common ancestors is now
        widely accepted and considered a fundamental concept in science.</p>
    <p>In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching
        pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for
        existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.</p>
    <p>Darwin was born on 12 February 1809 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England. He died on 19 April 1882 in Down, Kent,
        England.</p>
