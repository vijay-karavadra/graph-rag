    <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
    <p>Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of
        modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of
        science.</p>
    <p>Einstein is best known for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc², which has been dubbed "the world's most
        famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and
        especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of
        quantum theory.</p>
    <p>Einstein was born in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire on 14 March 1879. He died on 18 April 1955
        in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.</p>
